<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I make this rib-eye roast on the bone every time rib eyes are on sale. Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours medium-rare.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
    <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting pan.
    </li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium.</li>
</ol>
